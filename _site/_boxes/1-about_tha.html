<p>The Hamster Alliance is the one man music project I started in 1997, which has since expanded into the realms of video, graphic design, video games, voice over, and other work. Prior to The Hamster Alliance, I was Jamez the Giant Hamster on mp3.com. Now Iâ€™m just Hamst3r.</p>

<p>All of my music is freely available on the internet for listening. If you would like to use my music in a project, please send me an email.</p>
