<p>Hey! Got two new tunes for ya. A remix of the Stargrave boss battle music from KISS: Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child, and a remix of the music from the final level of Marathon.</p>

<p>The Stargrave remix is a raucous Metal affair that turns into a Drum and Bass banger. The Marathon remix, Splash, is a more Synthwave-y deal with big 80â€™s drums and an aggressive FM bass.</p>

<p>February 17, 2018 - Battle Disco</p>

<p>New track: <strong>Battle Disco</strong>! Took me a while to write this one as I just had no idea where I wanted to go with it. Finally things started to click and make sense, and here we are. Brass, strings, slap bass, lasers, bells, Moog synths, and a lot of dancey Disco flare.</p>
