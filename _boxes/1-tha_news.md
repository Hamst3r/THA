Hey! Check it out, it's a new website! Still working out some of the kinks, but the radio player over on the right,
or below if you're on mobile or a low resolution screen, should be completely functional. The downloads too.
There's even a download button to the right of every track title, so you can download individual tracks.

For those of you who post in the Shoutbox, it's down below. There's a [Shoutbox](http://www.hamsteralliance.com#shoutbox) link
above this that'll take you down to it too.

It's a pretty different layout overall, but I really wanted to simplify everything and get rid of all the page bloat.
So now, it's just this one page with some info about me, some links, a shoutbox, a music player, and downloads.
