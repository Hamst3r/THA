I'm in the mood to remake old tunes of mine and have so far completed: Unrealistic, Power, Arch Warrior, Corkscrew, Detach√© Paniq, Bermuda Shuffle, Fluffy Shit, and Salaryman! All standouts from my older catalogue and I think their updates are new standouts! I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them. :)
