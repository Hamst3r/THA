Well, here we go. It's time for Surfing on the Shores of Hell. Classic DOOM tracks remixed in a surf rock style, starting with Kitchen Ace and Sign of Evil. Will I do more of these? Who knows!

March 10, 2019 - Critical Structure Corruption!

It's been a long time, hasn't it? Well, I'm here with a new tune for 2019, full of Trap-inspired 808 drum rhythms, a lot of bass, distortion, glitches, and just a whole lot of slam whammery for the boom boomin' and the bop slappin'. I don't know what anything is anymore. The world is a confusing place.
