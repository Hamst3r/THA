Do you like drifting? Downhill racing? Getting your tire hooked into a gutter so you can take a corner faster? Well have I got the tune for you, it's called Running In The 90's. But after you've heard that, give Eurobeast a listen! It's got those Eurobeat synths, those overused orchestra hits, that "WOO!" sample, and just more Eurobeat style than you can shake a stick at.

May 19, 2018 - Remixes!

Hey! Got two new tunes for ya. A remix of the Stargrave boss battle music from KISS: Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child, and a remix of the music from the final level of Marathon.

The Stargrave remix is a raucous Metal affair that turns into a Drum and Bass banger. The Marathon remix, Splash, is a more Synthwave-y deal with big 80's drums and an aggressive FM bass.
