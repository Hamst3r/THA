It's been a long time, hasn't it? Well, I'm here with a new tune for 2019, full of Trap-inspired 808 drum rhythms, a lot of bass, distortion, glitches, and just a whole lot of slam whammery for the boom boomin' and the bop slappin'. I don't know what anything is anymore. The world is a confusing place.

July 24, 2018 - Eurobeast!

Do you like drifting? Downhill racing? Getting your tire hooked into a gutter so you can take a corner faster? Well have I got the tune for you, it's called Running In The 90's. But after you've heard that, give Eurobeast a listen! It's got those Eurobeat synths, those overused orchestra hits, that "WOO!" sample, and just more Eurobeat style than you can shake a stick at.
