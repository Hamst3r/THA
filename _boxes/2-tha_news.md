It's been a while since I last had anything new to share here. My life is still in a bit of disarray and the environment I'm in isn't condusive to a regular creative output. But even so, I did manage to put together this thing. This new track and the accompanying video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep7w4flDRYQ

Enjoy!
