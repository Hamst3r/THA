Hey! Check it out, it's a new website! Still working on layout stuff, but everything should be functional.

For those of you who post in the Shoutbox, it's down below now. There's a [Shoutbox](http://www.hamsteralliance.com#shoutbox) link
above this that'll take you down to it.

It's quite a change, but I really wanted a smaller, simpler website. So now, it's just this one page with some info about me,
some links, a shoutbox, a music player, and downloads. Also, do check out the new downloads, there's so much new stuff in there, both
old and new, that you've never heard before.
