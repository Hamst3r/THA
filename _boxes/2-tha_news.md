Hey! Check it out, it's a new website! Still working on layout stuff, but everything should be functional.

For those of you who post in the Shoutbox, it's down below now. There's a [Shoutbox](http://www.hamsteralliance.com#shoutbox) link
above this that'll take you down to it.

It's quite a change, but I really wanted a smaller, simpler website. So now, it's just this one page with some info about me,
some links, a shoutbox, a music player, and downloads. Check out the new downloads, entirely new packs, reorganized, renamed, and
added onto. The old THA Collection was around 175 tracks. This new collection is around 500.
