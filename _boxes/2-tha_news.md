Hey! Check it out, it's a new website! For those of you who post in the Shoutbox, it's down below now. There's a [Shoutbox](http://www.hamsteralliance.com#shoutbox) link above this that'll take you down to it.

There are a lot of new downloads on the right, 500+ tracks, many you've never heard. Plus instrumental versions of just about
every vocal track too. Check 'em out!
