The Hamster Alliance is the one man music project I started in 1997, which has since expanded into the realms of video, graphic design, video games, voice over, and other work. Prior to The Hamster Alliance, I was Jamez the Giant Hamster on mp3.com. Now I'm just Hamst3r.
 
All of my music is freely available on the internet for listening. If you would like to use my music in a project, please send me an email.
